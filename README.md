# Environment Quiz

The project name is "Environment Quiz". The goal of this project is to develop an application in Java that allows users to test their knowledge about environmental topics through a quiz.

## Overview

"Environment Quiz" is a semester group project for my Computer Science degree program at UNIP (Universidade Paulista). Our group is tasked with creating an interactive application that provides users with a set of questions related to the environment. The application will allow users to test their knowledge, learn new information, and raise awareness about environmental issues.

## Features

- Multiple-choice questions: Users will be presented with a series of multiple-choice questions related to various environmental topics.
- Scoring system: The application will keep track of the user's score based on the number of correct answers.
- Feedback: After answering each question, the user will receive immediate feedback indicating whether their answer was correct or not.

## Architecture

The "Environment Quiz" application follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architectural pattern to ensure a clear separation of concerns and facilitate code maintainability. The application's architecture consists of the following components:

- Model: The model component represents the data and business logic of the application. It encapsulates the quiz questions, user authentication, and score tracking functionalities. In this project, the model uses local variables to store and manage data, ensuring simplicity and ease of maintenance.
- View: The view component focuses on the presentation layer of the application. It provides a user-friendly interface for interacting with the quiz and displaying the questions. In this architecture, the view is responsible for rendering the quiz UI and receiving user input.
- Controller: The controller acts as an intermediary between the model and the view components. It handles user interactions, processes input from the view, and updates the model accordingly. The controller also ensures synchronization between the model and the view, keeping the application state consistent.

## Getting Started

To run the "Environment Quiz" application locally, please follow these steps:

- Clone the repository: git clone https://github.com/victorisena/environment-quiz.git
- Install Java Development Kit (JDK) version 8 or later: Download JDK
- Open the project in your preferred Java IDE (Integrated Development Environment).
- Build the project to resolve any dependencies.
- Run the application and start testing your knowledge about the environment!
